Hey Everyone,

This is my second C++ project. It's my first attempt to realize
my web GlobalNav app in C++. I'm quite happy with the web app
(it provides a route map which is kinda cool), and doing it
as a Windows app is the long-term goal. But, I started with a
CLI app so as to at least get the math right prior to starting
the Windows project. The math is non-trivial.

The app takes two airport codes and an approximate number of
waypoints as its arguments. The actual number of waypoints must
be one less than a power of two (because of how they're calculated),
so the number specified will be rounded up if necessary. A maximum
of 127 waypoints are supported.

This project uses a couple support classes. The code generates
a lot of strings, and many of them are temporary. Plus it reads
in a 276k data file. I didn't want to have to save a pointer
to each one for destruction purposes. So, I wrote BlockStringAlloc.

It's a simple memory reallocator that dispenses string pointers.
It keeps track of a list of blocks of memory to ensure proper 
deallocation. By default it allocates 64k blocks, but one of the 
constructors allows this to be changed.

The other class I wrote is StringHashIndex. I've been doing perl
for a long time and I really like hashes (associative arrays,
dictionaries) as a means of storing data. The ability to retrieve
data by a string key rather than an index value stops many bugs in
their tracks.

Since I knew where this project was going to go, I also wrote in
by-index access to both the keys and the values of the hash items.
This will be useful in the future Windows app when typing prediction
will be implemented.

Please send bug reports or other feedback to lars@piumasoft.com.

Thanks,
